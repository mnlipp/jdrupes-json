JDrupes JSON library.

JDrupes JSON Library
==================

This small library is based (and depends) on the 
[Jackson core library](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-core).

When XML support was included in the JDK, JavaBeans got their
{@link java.beans.XMLEncoder} and {@link java.beans.XMLDecoder}.
A similiar feature is still missing with regard to JSON. 

This library provides a {@link org.jdrupes.json.JsonBeanEncoder} and
{@link org.jdrupes.json.JsonBeanDecoder} that can be used to store and
retrieve the properties of JavaBeans (which is, of course, less 
comprehensive than the information generated by the 
{@link java.beans.XMLEncoder} for long term storage). 

The encoder and decoder also support arrays, collections and maps, so any
mixture of Java "container types" and JavaBeans can be handled. This
includes as a special case a Java object graph that consists only of
arrays, instances of {@link java.util.Collection} and instances
of {@link java.util.Map}.
